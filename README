## üöÄ Key Features

This demo fully implements the core features of the AIONEX experience:

### üé≠ Five Unique Personas
Connect with five distinct AI companions, each with their own personality, tone, and style of conversation:
* **Aura (The Mindful Guide):** Calm, empathetic, and insightful.
* **Zane (The Tech Innovator):** Sharp, logical, and futuristic.
* **Lyra (The Creative Storyteller):** Whimsical, imaginative, and artistic.
* **Rex (The Energetic Coach):** Motivating, bold, and a bit cheeky.
* **Nova (The Cosmic Explorer):** Curious, adventurous, and full of wonder.

### üß† A Connection That Remembers
* **Long-Term Memory:** The system extracts and saves key facts about you from conversations to create more natural interactions. (In this demo, this is simulated to show the feature's UI).
* **Shared Memories:** The platform generates short, sentimental "shared memories," creating a beautiful timeline of your connection.
* **Full Memory Control:** Through the settings panel, you have complete control to view and delete any fact the AI has remembered about you.

-----

### üí¨ Advanced Conversation Tools
* **Real-Time Streaming Responses:** AI responses are streamed token-by-token from the backend, creating the feeling of a live, dynamic conversation.
* **On-Demand Summarization:** Instantly get a bullet-point summary of the key topics discussed in your current chat.
* **Conversation Mood Analysis:** With a single click, the AI analyzes the overall mood of your conversation and provides a concise explanation.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Ready:** The interface includes controls for TTS. (In the full version, this is powered by advanced TTS models).

-----

### ‚ú® Immersive & Personalized UX
* **Dynamic Theming:** The UI and background change dynamically to match the personality of the selected AI companion.
* **Multi-Language Support:** The entire UI instantly switches between six languages: **English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Chinese, and Hindi**.
* **Daily Check-ins:** The AI greets you with a warm, personalized message on your first chat of the day.
* **Modern UI:** A sleek design featuring smooth animations, a dark mode, and a custom cursor for a polished experience.

## üõ† Technology Stack

This demo is built with a clean and efficient stack, showcasing a robust separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

| Area      | Technology          | Purpose                                                                          |
| :-------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend** | üêç **Python 3.10+** | Core application logic and server management.                                    |
|           | üåê **Flask** | A lightweight web framework for routing, requests, and serving the application.    |
|           | üßµ **Threading** | Manages background tasks for memory and summary generation without blocking the UI.  |
| **Frontend**| ‚ú® **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Handles all client-side logic, interactivity, and API communication.               |
|           | üé® **HTML5 & CSS3** | Structures the application and provides a modern, responsive design.               |
| **Database**| üóÑ **SQLite** | A self-contained, serverless database for storing conversations and user memory.   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The AIONEX demo architecture is designed for real-time, multi-layered processing:

1.  **UI Interaction:** The user selects a persona or sends a message from the frontend, which is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
2.  **API Request:** The frontend sends a request to the appropriate endpoint on the **Flask backend server**.
3.  **Backend Processing:**
    * The user's message is saved to the **SQLite database**.
    * For the `/chat` endpoint, a **simulated AI response** is generated. This response is then **streamed** back to the client token-by-token to realistically mimic a live AI typing.
4.  **Real-Time Rendering:** The JavaScript frontend receives the stream and dynamically renders the response word-by-word, updating the DOM.
5.  **Background Tasks:** After a conversation, new **threads** are initiated to run placeholder functions for memory extraction and shared memory creation, demonstrating the architecture for these features without exposing the core AI logic.

> **Key Demo Feature:** This project is **fully self-contained** and runs locally without requiring any external API keys.
